 * Post-execution evidence synthesis.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   1. Attach principle metadata to findings for traceability
 *   2. Pass through conclusion (principle internals stay in SSE progress events)
 *
 * Architecture note (2026-03-01 review):
 *   resolveEffectiveDecision() was removed because PrincipleEngine now skips
 *   the evidence check on turn 0 (no prior evidence expected). The previous
 *   pattern — PrincipleEngine always produces 'require_more_evidence',
 *   EvidenceSynthesizer retroactively patches to 'allow' — was a feedback
 *   loop where governance decisions were systematically overridden.
